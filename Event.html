    <p>An event management company online presence can have a massive impact on its growth and success. A website is a vital marketing tool as suggested by research conducted by Hubspot that showed about 78% of people are searching for events on the net. An event planning website assists the company in reaching the right target audience while increasing engagement. It helps to build an online presence and extend one’s reach to newer audiences irrespective of geographic boundaries.

    <p>The landing page is one of the most important pages on an event planner’s website. This is where the first impression of the brand is created. The page has to be created in a way that is easier to navigate with effective call-to-action buttons. A Call to Action is a key element on a webpage that helps the user to take action. The buttons need to have a bold design with a clear benefit and should be short in length. “ Book Now” or “Know More” are some of the prime examples of useful CTA buttons.

        Header images and graphics should be displayed at the top of the page. They help the user get a glimpse and set the tone of the company on the website. A section involving commonly asked questions can also be added that solves the user's query instantly and helps save time. It helps the users to make decisions.
